# Create a Build Environment

## Create a Repository
- You can either create a repo by clicking on the current (project-name) repo and selecting **Create New** or import a repo from somewhere else by selecting **Import**.

## CI/CD Pipelines
- Executes the Continuous Integration process
- Runs tasks when you submit code
- Uses a build agent. 
- Creates a build artifact.

## Build Agent
- An agent is installable software that runs one build or deployment job at a time. In Azure, we can use Microsoft hosted agent.
- Builds, tests and deploys code in the cloud
- Runs tasks in build definition.
- Pipeline -> Phases -> Task
- Tasks executed by agents.
- Agents can be grouped into agent pools.
- We can have **self-hosted agent** pools as well. Mostly though, it is better to work with **microsoft-hosted** agent pools.
